\chapter{Introduction}

$\ldots$
\\\par
We're extending the work done by Jacob H{\o}jgaard in his Masters Thesis 'Securing Single Sign-On Systems With Executable Models'. Jacobs research has focused on the current implementation of NemID and therefore describes, outlines and models the current system used in Denmark as of May 2013.
\\\par
Jacobs report sums up some of the problems with the current implementation of NemID, these problems include but are not limited to the system being very opaque. We're in the age of information, we want to be able to get information about everything regardless if it's in our best interest or not. NemID is not sharing any information about the internals of the system. If a person wanted to test some part of the NemID system, they would first have to analyze the public parts of the system to figure out how to communicate with the NemID system, afterwards all they would be able to do, would be black box testing. We need a system that is transparent, testable by everyone and doesn't cost a whole lot. For the sake of being able to reference this system through out the report, we will refer to it as \emph{OpenNemID}.

\section{Objectives}
Some explaining text here
\par

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Describe and outline the OpenNemID protocol, including but not limited to registration and login.
	\item Formalize the specification of OpenNemID in F* to the extent possible.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Scope}
This project has had it focus towards specifying a new protocol that could replace NemID. The intent of this project is therefore not to develop a complete system, but to make the specification for a system that could then later be developed based on the specification.

%%%%%%%%%% CHAPTER %%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Modelling the protocol}
Before formalizing the protocol, it's required to specify and explain some of the words, concepts and meanings used within the protocol. This will be done by using graphical representation of the message flow.

\section{Protocol prerequisites}
It's important to have some requirements as to how the systems should function. The requirements helps define certain properties the involved participants must have or obey to.

\subsection{Shared}
The NemLog-in specification mandates the use of OIOSAML, this will most likely not be excluded, therefore we assume that OpenNemID also has to use it. Further OIOSAML mandates the use of one-way SSL/TLS for all bindings, the mandate does not specify a specific version, though it can be assumed that a minimum version of SSL 3.0 due to the fact that SSL 2.0 is in general considered deprecated. We assume the use of SSL 3.0 or TLS 1.0 in this report.
\par
As mentioned before, SAML uses the browser to transfer messages from one principal to the other. The way to do this is through HTTP REDIRECTs, which could be either a HTTP-GET REDIRECT or a HTTP-POST REDIRECT. The HTTP protocol accepts a Location head in the HTTP RESPONSE which indicates where the browser should redirect to. The location header redirect will act as a HTTP-GET REQUEST which excludes the usage of POST data, thereby limiting the amount of data that can be transferred. To overcome this problem HTTP-POST REDIRECTs are used, these are not a part of the HTTP protocol, but is synthesized by using JavaScript to emulate a regular HTTP-POST REQUEST. Therefore it is required for the users browser to follow redirects and to have JavaScript enabled.
\par
For there to be any actual messages to flow between the service provider and identity provider, it's assumed that they reside in different domains and are different entities.
\par
The identity provider is only to issue assertions to known service providers, this requires that SAML metadata has been changed beforehand. The certificates used for signing and encrypting has to be checked for revocation and validity whenever used.
\par
\textbf{To summarize:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item OIOSAML mandates the use of SSL(3.0)/TLS(1.0).
	\item The browser must follow redirects.
	\item The browser must have JavaScript enabled.
	\item Service provider and identity provider are different entities residing in different domains.
	\item SAML metadata must have been exchanged between the service provider and identity provider.
	\item Signature check and encryption requires validity/revocation check of the certificate.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{NemID specifics}
It's required for the OCES certificates used for signing and encrypting to have been issued by DanID.

\subsection{OpenNemID specifics}
For the communication between the authentication provider and the identity provider, a secure tunnel must have been set up. Further the user must have registered at the authentication provider.
\par
We have assume the availability of a web cryptography API in this report. A web cryptography API has not yet been standardized, but a standardization is being worked on, a draft is available \cite{webcrypto}. 

\section{Formalizing protocol messages}
The UML communication diagrams depicting the protocols are made up of two or more participants, henceforth principals, and the messages flowing through the system. The line between two principals indicates a channel where communication can flow, this channel is assumed to be a secure channel, meaning for HTTP messages, the HTTPS protocol would be used. An arrow indicates the direction of the message and the text on top of the arrow is the message being sent. The messages does not conform to any specific formalism, but follows a simple syntax. Messages are, very applicable, named in accordance with their HTTP protocol verb. The messages are to be interpreted the following way:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[] \textbf{GET} means a HTTP-GET request, the parameter is the resource being requested.
	\item[] \textbf{POST} means a HTTP-POST request, the parameters are the destination for the request followed by the data being submitted.
	\item[] \textbf{REDIRECT} means either a HTTP-REDIRECT or a JavaScript redirect, whichever is used is not important for the purpose of the description. The parameters are the destination for the redirect followed by the parameters to include in the redirect.
	\item[] \textbf{RESPONSE} means a HTTP-RESPONSE messages. The parameters are either the data included in the response or a HTTP status code indicating the type of the response along with a message, this is used for indicating when error happen.
	\item[] \textbf{DELEGATE} means forwarding the data from the previous request, the parameters are the parameters from the previous request that were to be delegated.
	\item[] \textbf{AUTHENTICATE} is to be interpreted as the sequence of actions required to be authenticated at the specified NFactorChallenge. The AUTHENTICATE message is defined this generically on purpose, as the way a user would authenticate for a NFactorChallenge can vary a lot depending on which technology is used (SMS, Facebook, phone call etc.).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Communication model}
To make the changes from NemID to OpenNemID clear, we will first show the communication diagram for NemID, afterwards we will show the communication diagram for OpenNemID. Both diagrams make use of abbreviations, these abbreviations are listed at the top of the diagram along the word or phrase they abbreviate.

\subsection{Message processing}
Information regarding the processing of messages have not been included in the diagrams, this is to prevent cluttering of the diagrams. To circumvent this, the processing rules will be described afterwards. The descriptions will be linked to a specific process number, meaning Process 3 would be the handling and response of message 3 in the diagram. Messages that are self-explanatory will not be further described.

\subsection{Communication diagram for NemID}
Description of the message processing for this diagram has been left out of our report, they can however be found in Jacob H{\o}jgaards report \cite{jacob}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{images/Communication-Jacob.jpg}
	\caption{Communication diagram for the complete NemID protocol \cite{jacob}}
	\label{fig:jacobCommunication}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Communication diagram for OpenNemID}
In this diagram, we have chosen to leave out the additional request to another service provider than the one initially used, this is due to the communication flow being exactly the same as in Jacobs diagram, see Figure \ref{fig:jacobCommunication}, message 13 to 18.
\par
In the communication diagram for OpenNemID, DanID have been replaced by AuthenticationProvider, for the sake of our protocol it is of no greater importance which company handles the authentication.
\par
We have strived to minimize the amount of messages flowing through the system to limit the amount of possible attack points for a potential adversary. We have also eliminated the need for transporting sensitive data, such as the users login data, from the authentication provider to the identity provider, by mandating that the identity provider and the authentication provider exchange information using a secure tunnel without the user being able to interfere.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/Communication.png}
	\caption{Communication diagram for the OpenNemID protocol}
	\label{fig:ourCommunication}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Message descriptions}
Process 1 describes the creation of the AuthRequest at the service provider when a resource has been requested. Is the request resource not found a 400 Bad-Request message is returned. The use of url encoding (UrlEnc) and base64 encoding (Base64Enc) is to ensure that the data can be transferred as parameters in the URL.
\par
SAML and OIOSAML has a substantial amount of processing rules that dictates the processing of messages, disobeying these will cause an error. For the sake of communication the descriptions have been kept to a minimum, not listening all scenarios that would cause an error.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{Process 1}
	\begin{algorithmic}
	\REQUIRE{GET is well-formed \AND IdP.Public \AND SP.Private}
	\IF{R exists}
		\STATE AR $\leftarrow$ CreateAuthRequest()
		\STATE SAR $\leftarrow$ SIGN(AR, SP.Private)
		\STATE MA $\leftarrow$ UrlEnc(Base64Enc(DeflateCompress(AR)))
		\STATE RS $\leftarrow$ UrlEnc(Base64Enc(R))
		\RETURN REDIRECT(IdP, MA, SAR, RS)
	\ELSE
		\RETURN RESPONSE(400, Bad−Request)
	\ENDIF
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Process 3 describes the handling of a \emph{AuthRequest} at the identity provider. The request will be handled in one of two ways depending on whether the AuthRequest could be verified. In the case of verification failing, a SAML response will be returned indicating an error. Otherwise a page for requesting the users credentials is returned. The page returned will also contains the signed JavaScript for handling the OpenNemID specific actions. The JavaScript is signed using a certificate, \emph{IdPJsCert}, this certificate has to have been issued by the authentication provider.
\par
A challenge (nonce) is generated, this is to prevent an attack where an adversary would submit an identical request to one that has already been submitted, also known as a \emph{replay attack}. If the challenge wasn't introduced the second identical request would also be accepted.
\par
A cookie is created containing the AuthRequest, signed AuthRequest along with the relay state. This is done to free the identity provider from having to store the data, thereby granting more statelessness.
\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{Process 3}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\REQUIRE{GET is well-formed \AND IdP.Private \AND SP.Public \AND IdPJsCert.Public \AND IdP has JavaScript from AuthP}
		\STATE AR $\leftarrow$ DeflateDecompress(Base64Dec(UrlDec(MA)))
		\IF{VERIFY(AR, SAR, SP.Public)}
			\STATE C1 $\leftarrow$ GenChallenge()
			\STATE JS $\leftarrow$ GetStoredJavaScript()
			\STATE JS.SigParams.Challenge $\leftarrow$ C1
			\STATE JS.SigParams.Certificate $\leftarrow$ IdPJsCert.Public
			\STATE JS.SigParams.Signature $\leftarrow$ SIGN(JS.SigParams, IdPJsCert.Private)
			\STATE ARC $\leftarrow$ CreateCookie(MA, SAR, RS)
			\RETURN RESPONSE(JS, ARC)
		\ELSE
			\STATE RE $\leftarrow$ CreateResponse()
			\STATE RE.InResponseTo $\leftarrow$ AR
			\STATE RE.Status $\leftarrow$ ”VerificationFailied”
			\STATE MRE $\leftarrow$ Base64Enc(RE)
			\RETURN REDIRECT(SP, MRE, RS)
		\ENDIF
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

As specified in the formalization, it's required for the browser to allow JavaScript. The username, \emph{U} and password, \emph{P} for the user is not stored and fetched directly, but will be input by the user manually, though for the description of process 4 it will be assumed that they are both ready right away. Before the user is prompted for username and password, the JavaScript is verified. The challenge is submitted together with the username and password. Hashing of the username and password has been omitted as it holds no functional enhancement towards the protocol.
\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{Process 4}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\REQUIRE{U \AND P \AND Browser allows JavaScript}
		\STATE SigParams $\leftarrow$ Js.SigParams
		\IF{VERIFY(SigParams, SigParams.Signature, SigParams.Certificate)}
			\STATE C1 $\leftarrow$ SigParams.Challenge
			\RETURN POST(U, P, C1)
		\ELSE
			\PRINT ERROR
		\ENDIF
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

In process 5 the identity provider confirms that the challenge received matches a previously issued challenge, and that is has not already been used. A SAML response indicating an error is returned if the challenge is not accepted, otherwise the username and password will be delegated to the authentication provider.
\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{Process 5}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\REQUIRE{POST is well formed}
		\IF{C1 matches challenge issued by IdP \AND C1 is valid}
			\STATE \textbf{Delegate} U \AND P \TO AuthP
		\ELSE
			\RETURN RESPONSE(ERROR)
		\ENDIF
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Process 5.1 describes how the username and password submitted is used to identify a user at the authentication provider. If a user is found and is valid, a challenge will be generated and the next N-Factor challenge for the user will be fetched. The N-Factor challenge is signed and then returned. Were no valid user found based on the supplied username and password, a SAML response message indicating an error will be returned.
\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{Process 5.1}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\STATE USER $\leftarrow$ GetUser(U, P)
		\IF{USER is valid}
			\STATE C2 $\leftarrow$ GenChallenge()
			\STATE NF $\leftarrow$ GetNextNFactorChallenge(USER)
			\STATE NF.SigParam.User $\leftarrow$ USER
			\STATE NF.SigParam.Challenge $\leftarrow$ C2
			\STATE NF.SigParam.Certificate $\leftarrow$ USER.Public
			\STATE NF.SigParam.Signature $\leftarrow$ SIGN(NF.SigParam, USER.Private)
			\RETURN RESPONSE(NF)
		\ELSE
			\RETURN RESPONSE(ERROR)
		\ENDIF
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Process 6 show how the identity provider has to delegate messages from the browser to the authentication provider and vice versa. In this case the N-Factor challenge is to be delegated. If the authentication provider returned an error or the identity provider cannot verify the N-Factor challenge received, a SAML response message indicating an error will be returned to the browser. If the N-Factor challenge is verified, it is then delegated to the browser.
\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{Process 6}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\STATE SigParams $\leftarrow$ NF.SigParams
		\IF{VERIFY(SigParams, SigParams.Signature, SigParams.Certificate)}
			%\STATE RELATE(SigParams.User, SigParams.Challenge)
			\STATE \textbf{Delegate} NF \TO Browser
		\ELSE
			\STATE \textbf{Delegate} ERROR \TO Browser
		\ENDIF
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The browser also verifies that the N-Factor challenge is valid in process 6.1. An attempt to authenticate the N-Factor challenge is then performed. Due to the challenges genericity, the authentication process will not be further described.
\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{Process 6.1}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\STATE SigParams $\leftarrow$ NF.SigParams
		\IF{VERIFY(SigParams, SigParams.Signature, SigParams.Certificate)}
			\STATE AUTHENTICATE(NF)
		\ELSE
			\PRINT ERROR
		\ENDIF
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

In process 6.2, the genericity of the N-Factor challenges once more results in a minimal description. The way the authentication attempts will be handled depends on the N-Factor challenge, therefore to simplify the description, it is assumed that a result conforming to a specific template is returned.
\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{Process 6.2}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\STATE NFR $\leftarrow$ NFactorResult(NF)
		\RETURN RESPONSE(NFR)
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Process 6.5 describes the handling of a N-Factor challenge result. First off, the N-Factor challenge is verified to make sure that it has not been altered. Then it is checked whether or not the N-Factor challenge result is acceptable for the N-Factor challenge. In the case of acceptance the user is fetched. If the user has not yet completed all N-Factor challenges required to authenticate at the authentication provider, then the next challenge is fetched, signed and returned to the user. Process 6 to 6.5 is then repeated until no more N-Factor challenges are required, in which case login data for the user is created and returned to the identity provider. In case of the N-Factor challenge not passing verification or the N-Factor challenge result is not accepted a SAML message indicating an error is returned.
\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{Process 6.5}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\REQUIRE{User identifiable by (NF.SigParams.USER, NF.SigParams.Certificate)}
		\STATE SigParams $\leftarrow$ NF.SigParams
		\IF{VERIFY(SigParams, SigParams.Signature, SigParams.Certificate)}
			\IF{NFR is acceptable result of NF}
				\STATE USER $\leftarrow$ GetUser(SigParams.USER, SigParams.Certificate)
				\STATE C2 $\leftarrow$ GenChallenge()
				\IF{USER.HasNextChallenge}
					\STATE NF $\leftarrow$ GetNextNFactorChallenge(USER)
					\STATE NF.SigParams.User $\leftarrow$ USER
					\STATE NF.SigParams.Challenge $\leftarrow$ C2
					\STATE NF.SigParams.Certificate $\leftarrow$ USER.Public
					\STATE NF.SigParams.Signature $\leftarrow$ SIGN(NF.SigParams, USER.Private)
					\RETURN RESPONSE(NF)
				\ELSE
					\STATE LID $\leftarrow$ CreateLogInData(USER)
					\STATE ST $\leftarrow$ "OK"
					\RETURN RESPONSE(ST, LID)
				\ENDIF
			\ELSE
				\RETURN RESPONSE(ERROR)
			\ENDIF
		\ELSE
			\RETURN RESPONSE(ERROR)
		\ENDIF	
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

In process 7 it is described how the identity provider handles when a user has been authenticated at the authentication provider. If the returned status does not equal an acceptance criteria, the status is returned to the browser to indicate an error, the status would further describe the error. When the status is accepted the cookie created in process 3 is fetched and the contents on the cookie are extracted.
\par
The initial AuthRequest extracted from the cookie is verified. Failed verification results in the user being redirected to the service provider with information indicating that the AuthRequest could not be granted.
\par
When verification succeeds, an assertion is
\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{Process 7}

\chapter{Modelling with F*}
This chapter will introduce the language F* that can be used to model a security protocol. Despite being a formal specification language F* is also executable. F* is described as a \emph{A Verifying Compiler for Distributed Programming}. This chapter will describe how we have used F* to build a formal specification of our protocol shown in the previous chapter.

\section{Introducing F*}
F* is a research language from Microsoft Research. F* primarily subsumes two research languages from Microsoft Research, F7\footnote{http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/f7/} and Fine\footnote{http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/fine/}. F* is at this time considered to be an $\alpha$-release.The purpose of designing F* is to enable the construction and communication of proofs of program properties and of properties of a program's environment in a verifiable secure way. F* is a dialect of ML and compiles to .NET bytecode in type-preserving style. This means that it can interop with other .NET languages and the types defined in F* can be used by other .NET lanuages without loosing type information. Furthermore there also exists a fully abstract compiler from F* to JavaScript. This makes it possible to deploy F* programs on web pages as JavaScript meanwhile there is a formal guarantee that the program still behaves just as they would according to F* semantics. The compiling and type-checking of F* code utilizes the Z3\footnote{http://z3.codeplex.com/} SMT solver for proving assumptions made with refinement types. F* has been formalized and verified using Coq\footnote{Coq is an interactive theorem prover written in OCaml}.

\section{Syntax and semantics}
F* inherits syntax and semantics from ML. F* is a functional language which means that it has features like immutability by default, polymorphic types and type inference. In Listing 4.1 we have shown the classic Hello World example in F*. This is the simplest way this example could have been written. This example shows how to specify a main method 
\begin{lstlisting}[style=fstar, caption={Hello World example in F*}]
	module HelloWorld
	
	let _ = print "Hello world!"
\end{lstlisting}


\section{Refinement types}

\section{Protocol specification in F*}
The code in this section represents the state of the project now. This is in no way a complete implementation of the protocol. Implementation was carried out in an incremental manner. First the focus was on understanding Jacob's work and expanding that with the authentication part (Authentication Provider) of the protocol, which before was done by NemID, and then adding the functionality of creating login, establishing connection between Identity Provider and the Authentication Provider and so on. All of the code
